ASSIGNMENT 1:
19/19 test cases interpreted successfully.
19/19 test cases compiled and executed correctly.
Great work!

ASSIGNMENT 2: All test cases compile successfully.  Register
allocation is correct, but I note that you don't seem to be avoiding
the use of caller-save registers that conflict with calls, but are
instead pushing and popping the live variables. This is a good
solution, but it can result in excessive code size in some cases, as
can be seen in r1a_5 for example. Nevertheless, it works well, so full credit.


ASSIGNMENT 3: 
Please export a value named "typechecker," as specified on the Piazza.

23/23 test cases compiled and executed successfully. Well done! The
interpreter rejects some of your cases, and I encourage you to try to
make your compiler work with the interpreter so that you can more
easily test against it as the compiler gets more compilcated. That's
up to you, though, and as long as your compiler works with all our
tests you're doing well.

ASSIGNMENT 4:
All test cases interpreted and compiled successfully. Well done!

ASSIGNMENT 5:
6/19 test cases compiled successfully.
None of the test cases that failed compilation passed the interpreter past typechecking. 
Additionally, it seems that the test case r3_11 from the previous assignment causes your compiler to diverge.

Cases 2, 3, 11, 14, 15, 16 work fine, but the rest fail. It seems that
your typechecker is inserting types into the AST of the program (other
than the (type)) node, at least within function definitions.

     	     V failing test case from previous assignment
Grade: 31% - 1% = 30%

If you think this grade is in error please let me (mvitouse) know.
And remember that you can submit a fixed version of your compiler
within a week and get almost full credit!

ASSIGNMENT 5 (late):
All test cases pass successfully.

Final grade: 93%

ASSIGNMENT 6:
All test cases pass successfully. Well done!
