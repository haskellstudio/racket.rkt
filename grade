ASSIGNMENT 1:
19/19 test cases interpreted successfully.
19/19 test cases compiled and executed correctly.
Great work!

ASSIGNMENT 2: All test cases compile successfully.  Register
allocation is correct, but I note that you don't seem to be avoiding
the use of caller-save registers that conflict with calls, but are
instead pushing and popping the live variables. This is a good
solution, but it can result in excessive code size in some cases, as
can be seen in r1a_5 for example. Nevertheless, it works well, so full credit.
