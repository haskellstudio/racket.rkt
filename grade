ASSIGNMENT 1:
19/19 test cases interpreted successfully.
19/19 test cases compiled and executed correctly.
Great work!

ASSIGNMENT 2: All test cases compile successfully.  Register
allocation is correct, but I note that you don't seem to be avoiding
the use of caller-save registers that conflict with calls, but are
instead pushing and popping the live variables. This is a good
solution, but it can result in excessive code size in some cases, as
can be seen in r1a_5 for example. Nevertheless, it works well, so full credit.


ASSIGNMENT 3: 
Please export a value named "typechecker," as specified on the Piazza.

23/23 test cases compiled and executed successfully. Well done! The
interpreter rejects some of your cases, and I encourage you to try to
make your compiler work with the interpreter so that you can more
easily test against it as the compiler gets more compilcated. That's
up to you, though, and as long as your compiler works with all our
tests you're doing well.

ASSIGNMENT 4:
All test cases interpreted and compiled successfully. Well done!
